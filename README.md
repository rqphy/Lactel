## The idea

This is my first big project with Wonderstudios. It also is my first time working with Wordpress, I can’t wait to test that. I will create the front first and then make a Wordpress theme from it. The website needs to be responsive and will contain something like 8 pages. I got 10 days to do that so let’s get to work.

## The front-end

It would have been the perfect site to use a Javascript framework, unfortunately the deadline is coming quick and my team doesn’t want to take the risk. I will style use scss thought and I’ll try to make my classes as reusable as I can. The technical specifications are well defined. All the animations are precise and we have all the mockups on adobe XD. I’ve use Figma before so I guess I’ll be ok.

## The back-end

I’m not sure if I have permission to say a lot here but basically I’ve created a Wordpress theme from scratch. I try to use PHP as little as possible, sadly sometimes I need to comeback to it.

## Some issues

No issues for once! The whole project was great and I’m happy I’ve worked on a website for a brand that big.
